Take me break me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll cry
Go with me show me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll die
Lately I've been dancing in ceiling fans
Into the kitchen and out the back gat
Well I know it sounds strange but it could be the other way
Round to the ground where I know I must stay
Take me break me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll cry
Go with me show me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll die
Lately I've been dancing in ceiling fans
Circled in secrets playing a game
Well I know it sounds strange but it could be the other way
Round to a town where they don't know your name
Together....for a while....ain't no good





 Take it easy with me please
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze
Take your time make it slow
Andante Andante
Just let the feeling grow

Make your fingers soft and light
Let your body be the velvet of the night
Touch my soul you know how
Andante Andante
Go slowly with me now

I'm your music
 I am your music and I am your song
I'm your song
 I am your music and I am your song
Play me time and time again and make me strong
 Play me again 'cause you're making me strong
Make me sing make me sound
 You make me sing and you make me
Andante Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante Andante
Oh please don't let me down

There's a shimmer in your eyes
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
Please don't talk go on play
Andante Andante
And let me float away
I'm your music
 I am your music and I am your song
I'm your song
 I am your music and I am your song
Play me time and time again and make me strong
 Play me again 'cause you're making me strong
Make me sing make me sound
 You make me sing and you make me
Andante Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante Andante
Oh please don't let me down
Make me sing make me sound
 You make me sing and you make me
Andante Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante Andante
Oh please don't let me down
Andante Andante
Oh please don't let me down
 I'll never know why I had to go
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show
Boy I was tough packing all my stuff
Saying I don't need you anymore I've had enough
And now look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta have you near

As good as new my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new thank God it's true
Darling we were always meant to stay together

Feel like a creep never felt so cheap
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break
But please baby I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta get you near

I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again

As good as new my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new thank God it's true
Darling we were always meant to stay together

Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new
Darling we were always meant to stay together


 Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

 Well you hoot and you holler and you make me mad
And I've always been under your heel
Holy christ what a lousy deal
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I ain't gonna take it no more
Oh no no - walkin' out that door

Burning my bridges cutting my tie
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Being myself
Counting my pride
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges
Moving at last
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past
Gonna have peace now
You can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me


 Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed

Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain playing smart aching in our hearts

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on

You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Packing your bags being slow and thorough
Knowing though you're late that ship is sure to wait

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained blue eyes filled with pain

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I'm sorry Cassandra
I'm sorry Cassandra


 Chiquitita tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad so quiet

Chiquitita tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad so quiet

Chiquitita you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song Chiquitita


 I was out with the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cause I had to talk

I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before
And I closed my eyes will you leave me girl

Then I realized it's a crazy world
As he disapeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever dreamed

Everything in my life's part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about

And I closed my eyes will you leave me girl
Then I realized it's a crazy world
Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies

And you meet behind my back
With other guys fade
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me

I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see
Then you smiled and you took my hand
 There is something  you said  that you may not know

There's a couple of men in my life
And one of them is my brother Joe
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay

You'll be seeing a lot of him he's so nice in every way
Then I closed my eyes never leave me girl
Then I realized it's a crazy world
So I closed my eyes never leave me girl

Then I realized it's a crazy world
So I closed my eyes never leave me girl
Then I realized it's a crazy world


 I'm waitin' for you baby
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Oh Lord I'm blue
I'm cryin' over you
I'm waitin' for you baby
I'm sittin' all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Oh Lord I'm blue
I'm cryin' over you

Cryin' over you
I'm cryin' over you
Cryin' over
Little memories of things we used to do
Oh Lord I'm blue
I'm cryin' over you
Oh Lord I'm blue
I'm cryin' over you
Oh Lord I'm blue
I'm cryin' over you


 Oh my love it makes me sad.
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream everything we did everything we had?

Baby give me one more
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow.
Let's make it a memory a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance it's our way to say goodbye

Yes all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye

Yet it seems to make me sad.
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was is just a dream everything we did everything we had?

Baby give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird it's flying away
You tell me it's over what more can I say?
So dance while the music still goes on
It's gonna be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow.
Let's make it a memory a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me when you're gone
You know I won't forget you

 You can dance you can jive having the time of your life
See that girl watch that scene diggin' the Dancing Queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the Dancing Queen young and sweet only seventeen
Dancing Queen feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance you can jive having the time of your life
See that girl watch that scene diggin' the Dancing Queen

You're a teaser you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the Dancing Queen young and sweet only seventeen
Dancing Queen feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance you can jive having the time of your life
See that girl watch that scene diggin' the Dancing Queen
